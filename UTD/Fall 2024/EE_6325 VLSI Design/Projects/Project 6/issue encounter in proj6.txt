Issue I ran into during Project6:
	Some VDD and GND pins were not deleted from the combine .lib file for the cells
	The .lef file had a property command for each cell that need to be deleted "PROPERTY CatenaDesignType "deviceLevel" ;"
	The synthesis verilog file and the header filer was not concatenated properly ( the synthesis should come after the herder command lines)
	The clock port in the final synthesis file is different from the clock port name in the .lef file (CLK to clk )
	Make sure the ports for each cell combined synthesys+header verilog file matches the corresponding pin for each cell in the lef file
