**WARN: (IMPDF-1008):	The routing has wire-patches (that requires DEF 5.8 NETS RECT statements) in the signal routing that cannot be represented correctly in DEF 5.6 or 5.7. They will be converted to SPECIALNETS routing RECT shapes instead. This output is suitable for RC extraction tools, but this DEF should not be read back into Innovus as the routing data will not be correct. You should use DEF 5.8 to represent this routing data correctly by using "set dbgLefDefOutVersion 5.8".
Type 'man IMPDF-1008' for more detail.
