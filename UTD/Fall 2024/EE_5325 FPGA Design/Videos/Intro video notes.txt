/*
Design Process
	Idea: concieving of an idea
Implement: find physical manifestation of the idea
Test: test the idea for viability
Manufacture: build and create the idea

the design process can be subject to the following
subject ot iteration (refinement 
Hopefully converge

Prototype the design: implement the physical, useful to be flexible, see where real world and theoretical differs, modify as needed
	Breadboards
	PCBs
	Vrtual Prototypes
		Programmable Breadboards
		Software programmable
		FPGA eg:Baysys2 using Xilinx Spartan 3E FPGA
