Lecture 01 Take awayss
Read about the use of Pull-up and pull down resistors/diodes
Read about BJTs and MOSFETS
										MOSFET
MOSFET (Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor)
	Has 3 terminals Source-Gate-Drain
		Source and Drain has extra electrons as majority cariers
		Gate has an Oxide below it 
		Source and Gate are in a substrate which has electrons as Minority cariers as in P-Type substrate (not enough electrons in the substrate)
		When positive charge is applied to Gate elctrons field the gap between the Source and the Drain therby connectine the 2 and if positive charge is remove the electrons leave and the 2 get disconnected										
										BJT
BJT (Bipolar Junction Transistor)	
	Has 3 Terminals Collector-Base-Emiiter
										ROM
How ROM (Read Only Memory) is build: Note the input is usually and AND-Plane and product line feeds into the OR-Plane feeds the Output display
16X8 ROM = will have 4 inputs 16 outputs and each outputs will have 8 bits.  Input:n=4  Output: 2^(n) Thers is Chip Select function (C_S bar) to activate the chip 
										PROM (Programmable Read Only Memory)
Works the same as the ROM but has a BJT with Fusible Link (programmable)
Output has a Pull-Down resistor and a Inverter
										EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory)
Is a type of PROM that can be electrically erased becase it has a floating Gate Transistor
The transistor has 2 Gates one is floating and the other is connected to terminal that can be activate by positive charge
When Gate is active with enough Positve charge electrons can tunnel through because the oxide layer between the floating Gatte and the P-Type substrate is thin gut wide with the 2 Gates, 
Eleectrons get trap at the floating Gate with enough positive charge
To empty the floating gate apply enough a Positive charge at the Drain then the elctrons will leave the floating Gate
